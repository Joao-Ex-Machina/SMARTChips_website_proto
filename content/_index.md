The SMARTChips project aims at the design and development of a **configurable neural processing unit** (NPU) for
convolutional neural networks (CNN); and a framework to optimize these models and map them on
the configurable NPU. The project focuses on the three levels mentioned above with the following
contributions:
- A **framework for optimization and transformation** of the deep learning models for
embedded computing;
- A **novel architecture** to deal with **low-power and high-performance
execution** of deep learning models in embedded solutions.
- Designing of the system ASIC to the final product.

Designing efficient high-performance edge computing solutions for the execution of accurate AI models is quite
relevant for the proliferation of AI. The configurable Neural Processing Unit proposed in this project is
a step forward to this objectove. This is in line with the [European Chips Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-chips-act) to reinforce the capacity to
innovate in the design, manufacturing and packaging of advanced chips.
