# About {#about}
The **SMARTChips** project aims to design and develop a **configurable Neural Processing Unit (NPU)** tailored for the efficient execution of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, together with a comprehensive framework to **optimize, transform, and map deep learning models** onto the proposed hardware architecture.

The project addresses this challenge across three tightly coupled levels, with the following main contributions:

- The development of a **framework for optimization and transformation** of deep learning models targeting **embedded computing platforms**;
- The proposal of a **novel NPU architecture** enabling **low-power yet high-performance execution** of deep learning workloads in embedded systems;
- The **end-to-end design of an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)** implementing the finalized system.

Designing efficient, high-performance edge computing solutions capable of executing accurate **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** models is a key enabler for the widespread adoption of AI technologies. The configurable NPU proposed in this project represents a concrete step forward toward this objective, bridging the gap between model accuracy and hardware efficiency in resource-constrained environments.

This work aligns with the goals of the **[European Chips Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-chips-act)**, contributing to the reinforcement of Europe’s capacity to innovate in the **design, manufacturing, and integration of advanced semiconductor technologies**.
